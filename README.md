Very simple registration and login page using tkinter in python. 

Prompts user to either login or register. 

If login, it will read input and check if matches with info stored in .csv file called "pswds.csv".

if register, will write into the "pswds.csv" file, the users input info. 

Must have Pythin and tkinter installed.
